Software developer and all around nerd. I am applying the skills I have learned since graduating from Emerging Digital Academy to new personal projects while learning new concepts and languages.

I have been drawn to problem solving and puzzles since I was young and software development l allows me to keep developing those skills and express my creative side.

In my free time, I love exploring new video games or creating sessions for Dungeons and Dragons. I also enjoy a great day with my family out on lake.
