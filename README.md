Former Team Lead - Fargo Customer Support at Digi-Key, I recently graduated from Emerging Digital Academy, a 20 week full time full stack development bootcamp in Fargo, ND after a career as a dedicated leader and trainer with a passion for quality control and extensive experience in inventory management and diverse, cross-functional team leadership. 

I have been drawn to problem solving and puzzles since I was young and software development l allows me to keep developing those skills and express my creative side.

In my free time, I love exploring new video games or creating sessions for Dungeons and Dragons. I also enjoy a great day with my family out on lake.

I am currently learing C#/.NET framework and Python/Flask.
